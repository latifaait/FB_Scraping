# FB_Scraping
Popular sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube often provide their APIs publicly for developers to access their data in a structured way. But when APIs are not available or different data needs to be extracted, a web scraping program is built using Python, Ruby, and PHP, in order to access and download web information without an API. Historically, web scraping programs are often called bots, crawlers, spiders, harvesters, etc. In this project, we will see Facebook scraping using Selenium, Beautiful Soup.
